## Comments

- The majority of failing CI Pipelines for Phase 2 is a result of commenting out “test” from the stages section of the .gitlab-ci.yml file. This was done to avoid wasting our free minutes for the GitLab pipeline runner.
- The setup for the About page was partially inspired by the team WeLikeSportz. Their codebase is linked here: https://gitlab.com/debbiew27/WeLikeSportz/
- The backend EB setup referenced the following guide: https://github.com/forbesye/cs373/blob/main/Flask_AWS_Deploy.md, therefore our backend/Dockerfile, backend/nginx.conf, backend/start.sh, and backend/uwsgi.ini files are all inspired by that resource.
